 Scientific Programming Final Project 
This project is a console-based C++ program that simulates a small aircraft flight using validated user input. The system models aircraft specifications and calculates flight metrics such as gross weight, ground speed, travel time, and fuel usage based on real-world constraints. The project uses object-oriented design, input validation, and file I/O to output results to both the console and a text file.

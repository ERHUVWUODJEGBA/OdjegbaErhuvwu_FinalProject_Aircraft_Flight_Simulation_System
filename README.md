 Scientific Programming Final Project: 
This project is a console-based C++ program that simulates a small aircraft flight using validated user input. The system models aircraft specifications and calculates flight metrics such as gross weight, ground speed, travel time, and fuel usage based on real-world constraints. The project uses object-oriented design, input validation, and file I/O to output results to both the console and a text file. This simulation is based on the following metrics: 
Aircraft model: Cessna 172 Skyhawk

Departure airport: Bradford Regional Airport (BFD)

Arrival airport: John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH)

Distance traveled between BFD and CMH (miles and nautical miles)

True airspeed (TAS) of the aircraft

Ground speed adjusted for a 20 mph headwind

Cruise time based on wind-adjusted ground speed

Total travel time including takeoff (5 minutes) and landing/taxi (10 minutes)

Fuel burned during cruise

Total fuel used (1.5 gallons for takeoff, cruise fuel, and 2 gallons for landing)

Required reserve fuel (45 minutes at 8 gallons per hour)

Total fuel remaining at landing

Usable fuel remaining after reserve

Fuel weight burned (6 pounds per gallon)

Landing weight of the aircraft
